# simple-schedule
### A simple weekly schedule library
A straightforward prototype for defining a weekly schedule in javascript, that can be queried with `moment`, `Date`, and unix timestamps.

Presently, it supports basic isOpen, isClosed functionality.

It transparently uses AMD or CommonJS (in node.js), or it will attach itself to the global object in other instances as `SimpleSchedule`. It requires [underscore.js] (http://underscorejs.org/ "Underscore.js") and [moment](http://momentjs.com/ "Moment.js | Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in javascript.").

## Example
    var schedule = new SimpleSchedule(json_schedule);

    // Assuming you're open at noon on Tuesdaysâ€¦
    var tuesday_at_noon = moment().hours(12).day(2);

    schedule.isOpen(tuesday_at_noon);
    // #=> true
    schedule.isClosed(tuesday_at_noon);
    // #=> false

    // ... and closed in the middle of the night
    var middle_of_the_night = tuesday_at_noon.clone().add('hours', 13)

    schedule.isOpen(middle_of_the_night);
    // #=> false
    schedule.isClosed(middle_of_the_night);
    // #=> true

    // If no time is provided, it will default to the current time.
    schedule.isOpen();
    // #=> true / false depending
